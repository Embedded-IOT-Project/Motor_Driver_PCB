Schematic for the Motor Driver
![Motor Driver Schematic](Motor_Driver_Schematic.png)

## Features

- **High current support:** Each BTS7970B handles up to **43A** continuous
- **Full H-Bridge configuration:** Two half-bridges combined to drive motors bidirectionally
- **PWM-based speed control:** Controlled via STM32 microcontroller
- **Built-in protections:** Overcurrent, thermal shutdown, and short-circuit detection
- **Encoder interface:** Connector provided for motor encoder signals

---

## How It Works

- **BTS7970B Half-Bridges**: Each chip controls one motor terminal.
- **Motor OUT A / B**: Connected to the motor leads.
- **PWM_A / PWM_B**: Determine direction and speed via PWM.
- **EN_A / EN_B**: Enable/disable each half-bridge.
- **IS (Current Sense)**: Connected to an ADC pin for current feedback.
- **PWR_FLAG / Vm / GND**: Motor power supply and net flags.

## Connectors

- `J1` – Input signals from microcontroller
- `J2` – Motor power input (Vm, GND)
- `J3` – Motor outputs and encoder header

## Notes

- Add **0.1µF** and **470µF** decoupling capacitors for stability
- Use proper cooling or heatsinks for high current use
- Ensure VM power supply can handle motor surge currents
